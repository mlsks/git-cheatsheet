# Main Application JavaScript Documentation

The main.js file serves as the entry point and orchestrator for the Git Commands Cheat Sheet application. It initializes all the core modules and ensures proper application startup.

## Overview

The main JavaScript file follows a modular architecture pattern, initializing different components of the application when the DOM is fully loaded. This approach ensures clean separation of concerns and maintainable code structure.

## Implementation Details

### Event Listener Setup

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  // Module initialization
});
```

The code uses the 'DOMContentLoaded' event to ensure that all HTML elements are available before initializing the application components. This is a best practice to prevent any potential DOM-related errors.

### Module Initialization

The application initializes four main modules:

1. **Search Module**
   ```javascript
   const search = new Search();
   ```
   - Handles the search functionality
   - Enables real-time filtering of Git commands
   - Manages search input and results display

2. **Theme Manager Module**
   ```javascript
   const themeManager = new ThemeManager();
   ```
   - Controls the application's theme switching
   - Manages light/dark mode functionality
   - Handles theme persistence

3. **Navigation Module**
   ```javascript
   const navigation = new Navigation();
   ```
   - Manages page navigation features
   - Handles keyboard shortcuts
   - Controls section navigation indicators

4. **Clipboard Module**
   ```javascript
   const clipboard = new Clipboard();
   ```
   - Manages command copying functionality
   - Provides copy feedback
   - Handles clipboard operations

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Modularity
- Each component is independently instantiated
- Modules are loosely coupled
- Easy to maintain and modify individual components

### 2. Initialization Order
- Controlled sequence of module initialization
- Prevents dependency issues
- Ensures proper feature availability

### 3. Clean Code Structure
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to understand architecture
- Maintainable codebase

### 4. Scalability
- Easy to add new modules
- Simple to extend functionality
- Flexible architecture for future updates

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Event Handling
- Proper event listener usage
- Waits for DOM readiness
- Prevents race conditions

### 2. Module Pattern
- Object-oriented approach
- Class-based architecture
- Clean instantiation process

### 3. Performance
- Efficient initialization
- No blocking operations
- Optimal resource usage

### 4. Error Prevention
- Safe module loading
- Proper event timing
- Robust initialization process

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Dependencies
- Requires other module files to be loaded
  - search.js
  - theme.js
  - navigation.js
  - clipboard.js

### 2. Loading Order
- HTML document must load first
- Module files must be included before main.js
- Proper script ordering in HTML

### 3. Browser Support
- Works in modern browsers
- Uses standard JavaScript features
- No legacy browser considerations needed

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Adding New Modules
To add a new module:
1. Create the module class in a separate file
2. Import the file in index.html
3. Initialize in main.js
4. Ensure proper dependency management

### 2. Maintaining the Code
- Keep initialization simple
- Maintain module independence
- Document any new additions
- Follow existing patterns

### 3. Testing Considerations
- Test module initialization
- Verify proper loading order
- Ensure module independence
- Check for potential conflicts

## Conclusion

The main.js file serves as a clean and efficient orchestrator for the application's various components. Its simple yet effective design ensures proper initialization of all features while maintaining code quality and performance standards.
